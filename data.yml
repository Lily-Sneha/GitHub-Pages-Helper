- name: 1. Getting started with your GitHub account
  description: Getting started with your GitHub account is easy. First, create an account on the GitHub website. Once you've signed up, you can start creating and managing repositories, which are the basic units of work on GitHub. You can create new repositories to store and share your code, or contribute to existing ones by submitting pull requests. GitHub also allows you to collaborate with other users by forking their repositories and making changes, or by inviting them to join your own projects. In addition to code, you can also use GitHub to host documentation, project websites, and other types of content. With its powerful tools for version control, issue tracking, and collaboration, GitHub is a valuable resource for developers and anyone looking to manage and share their work online.

- name: 2. Creating a GitHub Pages site
  description: To create a GitHub Pages site, start by creating a new repository on GitHub and giving it a name in the format `<username>.github.io`.

- name: 2. How to update website contents
  description: To update website contents on GitHub, you need to make changes to the files that are stored in your repository. You can do this by editing the files directly on the GitHub website or by making changes to the files on your local computer and then pushing those changes to the repository using Git commands. Once the changes are pushed to the repository, they will be live on your website. It's important to check the website to make sure the changes look and work as intended. If there are any issues, you can make further changes and push them to the repository until the website is updated correctly.
